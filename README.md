#Math Expression Converter

5CHackathon Project - April 15-16, 2016

Our project is a web app that can convert raw mathematical text between various math languages such as LaTeX, Wolfram's Mathematica, and MATLAB. So far, we can parse LaTeX expressions and convert it into other languages. This will benefit students in technical fields, including math, physics, and engineering.

We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery for this project.

The main strategy is to convert the raw text into our intermediate language, and then translate that into LaTeX, Mathematica, and MATLAB.

In the future, we will try to parse other languages such as Mathmetica and MATLAB. We are also looking into parsing Maple (used in physics). In addition, we are interested in integrating WolframAlpha's API in order to parse natural languages and add insight to our output.
