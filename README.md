#Math Expression Converter

5CHackathon Project - April 15-16, 2016

Our project is a web app that can convert raw mathematical text between various math languages such as LaTeX, Wolfram's Mathematica, and MATLAB.
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project.

The main strategy is to convert the raw text into an internal language, and then translate that into LaTeX, Mathematica, and MATLAB.
